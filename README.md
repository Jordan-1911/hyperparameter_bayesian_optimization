<h1>Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning</h1>

<p>In machine learning, hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before training a model. Tuning these hyperparameters can often lead to a significant improvement in model performance. However, the process of hyperparameter tuning can be time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex models.</p> 
<p>Bayesian optimization is a technique for hyperparameter tuning that can help reduce the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning. It works by constructing a probabilistic model of the objective function, which is the metric we want to optimize (e.g. accuracy, AUC, F1 score, etc.), and using this model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters. The basic idea is to iteratively choose a set of hyperparameters to evaluate, update the probabilistic model based on the results of the evaluation, and then use the updated model to choose the next set of hyperparameters to evaluate.</p> 
<p>This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates how to use Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning in Python, using the Hyperopt library. The notebook assumes that you have a basic understanding of machine learning and hyperparameter tuning, and it provides a step-by-step guide to using Bayesian optimization with Hyperopt.</p>
